click
=====

control the mouse efficiently using the keyboard!

## Why?

for those who use vi/emacs, screen, vimperator, but still sometimes have to lose time taking the hands of the keyboard to click somewhere, now you can click efficiently anywhere using only the keyboard.

## How?

divinding the screen recursively so that it is possible to address any pixels with a logarithm number of keystrokes.

## Features

mouse movement, left/right/middle/double click, drag-and-drop.

## Help

create a keyboard shortcut that executes click (System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts)

commands:
- '1' to '9': move the mouse
- '0', 'z', space, backspace: go back one level
- enter: left click
- shift+enter: right click
- shift+alt+enter: middle click
- ctrl+shift+enter: left drag
- ctrl+alt+shift+enter: double click
- '!', '[', ']', esc: exit
