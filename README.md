click
=====

control the mouse efficiently using the keyboard!

## Why?

for those who use vi/emacs, screen, vimperator, but still sometimes have to lose time taking the hands of the keyboard to click somewhere, now you can click efficiently anywhere using only the keyboard.

## How?

divinding the screen recursively so that it is possible to address any pixels with a logarithm number of keystrokes.

## Features

mouse movement, left/right/middle/double click, drag-and-drop.
